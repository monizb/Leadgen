## 🏆  What is Leadgen?
Open Source Contribution events happen ever so often these days, manually counting the scores of each contirbutor and setting up a point based leaderboard can become painful and messy ver easily, on the other hand using the Github API can be very intimidating due to its ridiculous quota limitations. Leadgen is a simple yet powerful API that helps you easily generate a leaderboard for your events, all you need is a list of repositories, a common label to dentify in-scope PRs, Point based labels and the corresponding points!

## 🚧 Roadmap
Currently Leadgen is in its very initial stages with the most important core features implemented which includes user-signups, leaderboard creation, server job creation, job run and status updates and leaderboard generation. Leadgen aims to extend eventually to the following features:

1) Multiple access key architecture where more than one Github token is used to accomodate a larger amount of generations at one time without hitting the quota limit.

2) View creations: Send back template-based ejs generated leaderboards so that the users don't need to style them on the frontend

3) Create a frontend app: For Non-API users, create a frontend ReactJS based app for easier creations and management

4) Scale larger than leaderboard generation: On the longer run, this API aims to convert itself into a complete event managment system with ticket bookings, quizzes etc.
